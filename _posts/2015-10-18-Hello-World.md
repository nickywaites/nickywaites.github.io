Obligatory Hello World Post

This blog was originally hosted in an Umbraco CMS but the overhead of managing a CMS led me to decide to switch to a GitHub Pages blog after seeing how easy they are to create.  Set-up was made simple by following along with [http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
