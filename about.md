My name is Nicky Waites.  I am a software engineer with over 10 years experience building web applications for the oil & gas industry.  I've been fortunate enough to experience working full stack in .NET on a number of brown and green field projects.  I enjoy taking projects from their initial concept right through to seeing them solving actual problems and users enjoying the experience. 

When I'm not writing software for work I'm hobby crafting for the web and games experimenting with the latest web frameworks and writing games in unity.  

### More Information

Outside of work I'm spending time with my great wife and two daughters in and around Scotland.
